/*
The modal div should have a position fixed and take up the entire
width and height of the window. The modal-background should also
take up the entire width and height of the window and have a
position absolute. The modal-content div should be centered
inside of the modal div by flexing the modal div and have
a position of absolute. You may want to give the
modal-background a background-color of rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7)
and the modal-content a background-color of white just to see them better.
